Firetrap helps you create modern, safe and extensible FTP servers in Rust.

Because of its plugable authentication and storage backends (e.g. local filesystem, Google Buckets) it's more flexible than traditional FTP servers and a perfect match for the cloud.

**Due to personal reasons, I'm no longer working on this project. Firetrap has
since been forked by my previous employer who is continuing development on
[unFTP](https://github.com/bolcom/unFTP). This repository now serves only as an
archive.**

[API Documentation](https://docs.rs/firetrap)

## Prerequisites

You'll need [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) 1.31 or higher to build firetrap.
There are no runtime dependencies besides the OS and libc.

## Getting started

If you've got Rust and cargo installed, create your project with

```sh
cargo new my_project
```

Then add firetrap to your project's dependencies in `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
firetrap = "0.1"
```

Now you're ready to write your server!
Add the following to `src/main.rs`:

```rust
extern crate firetrap;

fn main() {
  let server = firetrap::Server::with_root(std::env::temp_dir());
  server.listen("127.0.0.1:2121");
}
```

You can now run your server with `cargo run` and connect to `localhost:2121` with your favourite FTP client :)

For more examples checkout out the [examples](./examples) directory.
